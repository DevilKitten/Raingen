Fan-made community project aiming to change Clangen to take place in Rain World's setting. 

It's a work in progress! You can contribute to it anytime through our [discord server](https://discord.gg/Zyj6vTq4rS). 

## Installation
There is no release yet, but you can still play the unfinished version. Works the same as source version clangen, if you're familiar with it. If you're not:

Click the green "Code" button on top of this page, then "Download ZIP". Unzip it and then follow [this tutorial. The process is described for lifegen, but it works for raingen too](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iakhi3sWnx9ubc3njK4k07xttQilN5W4WITgknla59Q/edit).

Release version is in the works though!!
